This text adventure is a Sci-fi collection of what is out there
and not. The ideas I want to convey stretch are from novels 
read about space and time, star trek, rick and morty, aliens,
and other interesting tales and intermixing video game 
nostalgia of early games and what made them quarter suckers.
